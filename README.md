🚇 Toronto TTC Subway Delay Analysis (2025)

📊 Project Overview
This project provides an end-to-end data analysis of Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) subway delays. By extracting raw incident data from a MySQL database and transforming it into an interactive Power BI dashboard, I uncovered critical system bottlenecks and temporal delay patterns that impact thousands of daily commuters.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills
Data Extraction & Cleaning: SQL (MySQL)

Data Visualization: Power BI Desktop

Data Modeling: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

🏗️ Data Architecture
The project follows a standard BI lifecycle:

Extract: Queried over 5,000 incident reports from the TTC Open Data stored in MySQL.

Transform: Used DAX to engineer custom columns, specifically a 24-hour "Rush Hour" grouping to fix raw timestamp formatting.

Load: Imported refined datasets into Power BI for high-performance visual rendering.

📈 Key Insights
Systemic Impact: The analysis identified a staggering 40,242 minutes of total system delays.

Critical Bottlenecks: Wilson Station (1,514 mins) and Eglinton Station (1,314 mins) emerged as the most significant delay points on Line 1.

Peak Risk Hours: Visualized a clear spike in delays at 1 AM and 6 PM, providing actionable data for transit planning.
